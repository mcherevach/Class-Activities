      <p> My name is Marina, I'm 23 and other than run on sentences there isn't really much else I'm too good at. Even the kayaking I was terrible, my friend was in front and pretty much pulling all the weight. I have 2 dogs and a grumpy cat. I love going hiking but I don't take the smaller dog because he's kind of a protective asshole and he tries to bite peoples ankles when they walk by. Currently I'm a dental assistant but I am making a career change as over the past year or so I've really honed in on what I want my future to be like and know exactly what I want to accomplish in the next 5 years and the next 10 years. Thanks to the covid lockdowns I was able to get into the mental headspace to take that leap and just do it rather than thinking about doing it. </p>
